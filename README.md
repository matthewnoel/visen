# Visen

A screenplay visualization tool.

## About

### Should I use this project?

Sure, but note that it's being developed by [this guy](https://github.com/matthewnoel) for a script that he's writing, and you should expect breaking changes whenever.

### Can I contribute?

Sure, but note that this is currently an autocracy, and thorough contribution guidelines will be established later. You're a pretty cool cat for wanting to get in early, though!
